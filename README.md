Using profile data from a month or so ago, viewing unique users to go to conversion or nonconversion. I haven't figured out how to make my ec2 instance work as a server yet so it's just an html file you can start your own server for :D

USAGE
=====
Within this directory (I'm lost at other directories as of yet with silly __init__.py things), I've got a ./test.py:

```python
from csv2db import csv2db
from 

# import data to database
