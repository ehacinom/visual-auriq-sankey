Using profile data from a month or so ago, viewing unique users to go to conversion or nonconversion. I haven't figured out how to make my ec2 instance work as a server yet so it's just an html file you can start your own server for :D

Also, all links to d3.js are on my own server. not sure how sustainable this is
- d3.js, index.html optimized for local machine
- python code in json_sankey.py using libraries and MySQL and database on ec2
